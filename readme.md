##Carl Sagan. Everywhere.##
SaganIZER is an extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox created for the [Carl Sagan Day 2014](http://carlsaganday.com/). 

**What this extension does:**
 - Replaces all images with random Carl Sagan images.
 - Replaces the word "God" by "Sagan".

**What this extension doesn't does:**
 - A coffee.
 - A vortex.
 - Pseudoscience.
 - A Spacetime Odyssey.
 
Okay, I will try to be seriously. saganIZER is an extension that replaces all images from all websites with random Carl Sagan images. This extension also replaces the word "God" (case-insensitive) by "Sagan" (in short is the same thing).

##Contribute##
Feel free to suggest features, fork, comment, criticize and make me a coffee. Pull-requests are **really** welcome, don't fear, I don't bite. If you can share, publish and invite your friends to know this useless extension, the maximum they can do is tell you to fuck yourself and go back to the 70's.
